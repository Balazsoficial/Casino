A basic roulette game written in c++ console, it has some basic and easily codeable functions
like black/red even/odd and pick a specific number.
Rn the project was in one file but i am sure that it will change in the future since 
its site is getting out of hand alredy.
There is a currency system designed to last if you restart the game and also future products might use this file!
This project if just for my entertainment and practice, help me out if you want to!
This project is entirely developed by @Balazsoficial
